#This module works as a linear programming based solver for DDML problem
module RereDmlLpSolver
using JuMP,Clp
using HiGHS
export solveDmlLp


# Originally Diag-DML and its â„“_1 regularization solve DDML problems using a Scala library called "SCPSolver.jar", to utilize the parallel computation of Spark.
# Now we have re-implemented the LP solver of D-DML usring the pure Julia implementation, given that Julia's distributed computing is mature now

#  It has three typical use cases: (1) The solver of the DML problem when no regularization is used; (2) The solver of the DML problem when L1 regularization is used; (3) The solver of the optimization problem in the first line of the ADMM functions (Eq. 15).
